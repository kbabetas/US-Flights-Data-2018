    "Provide a \"misery index\" for airports. That is, sort the airports in descending order of the probability that a flight departing from that airport has a delay. Take care of outliers: some airports may have a preposterously low number of flights. We are not interested in them. Your criterion for outliers will be the airports in the lowest 1% percentile in the number of flights.\n",

In your notebook you will read the data by assuming they reside in the same directory as your code. Your submission will *not* include the data.\n",

    "The documentation must be at the level where somebody that has some Pandas and Python knowledge can understand exactly what you are doing and why. Your output must be as user-friendly as possible. That means that your output tables should not include zillions of columns that are not needed for your analysis."

    "You understand that this is an individual assignment, and as such you must carry it out alone. You may seek help on the Internet, by Googling or searching in StackOverflow for general questions pertaining to the use of Python and pandas libraries and idioms. However, it is not right to ask direct questions that relate to the assignment and where people will actually solve your problem by answering them. You may discuss with your fellow students in order to better understand the questions, if they are not clear enough, but you should not ask them to share their answers with you, or to help you by giving specific advice."
