# US-Flights-Data-2018
Exploring US Flights Data for 2018

This repository will serve as a place where the project from the course **Applied Machine Learning** will be uploaded. The course is part of the curriculum of the Department of Management Science and Technology from the Athens University of Economics and Business and the project is assigned by [Panos Louridas](https://github.com/louridas).

## Dataset

The Dataset that was used for the project is the [Airline On-Time Performance Data](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/Tables.asp?DB_ID=120&DB_Name=Airline%20On-Time%20Performance%20Data&DB_Short_Name=On-Time#) and we will use the 2018 data that can be found [here](<https://auebgr-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/louridas_aueb_gr/EbeTzde1LddFmqNWBFWWxNcBj5tDR_zvzDHvqqcmnndeEQ?e=0pwH6j>).

The following answers assume that the data will reside in the same directory as this notebook in a folder called Data.

You will need to download manually the dataset in order to run the Jupyter Notebook.

## Assignment

The Assignment Instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/kbabetas/US-Flights-Data-2018/blob/master/Assignment_1_US_Flights.ipynb).

The focus of the project was to evaluate the performance of each airline regarding the flight delay that occurred in each individual flight.
